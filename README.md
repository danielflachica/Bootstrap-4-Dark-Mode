### Project Summary
This is a simple implementation of a button element which can toggle a page's state from Light to Dark Mode or vice versa. It's made entirely with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) and is highly customizable. 

### Documentation
The documentation for this project can be found [here](https://danielflachica.github.io/Bootstrap-4-Dark-Mode/) along with an interactive demo.
